NOTES for intro to react:

-in eslistrc.json
prettier must come last

-tslint
typescript linter!!

git course by nina is great!

-parcel
webpack alternative
point at a file, it compiles it
saves developer time but might not always be the fastest or smallest
maybe start with parcel then move to esbuild or vite
**_if something is broken change back to parcel 2.3.2 or something_**
**_if something gets weird delete the parcel cache and dist directory_**

-lodash is huge
no one uses all of lodash
mentions tree-shaking for keeping apps smaller
selective import !== destructuring

What is a bundler?

-In package.json
"browserslist": [
"last 2 Chrome versions"
]
bad practice for production code
"regenerator runtime not found" -- delete cache check browserslist video segment

-React benefit = seperation of concerns
-by seperating things into components
-view = html
-style = tailwind/css

es4 tried to do jsx - failed

SEARCH FORM COMPONENT
